			<h1>It's 2082.</h1>
			<p>Your species has finally pushed your home planet past its breaking point: the atmosphere isn't only a greenhouse but just plain unsafe to breathe, and toxic crops are killing millions. Naturally, world leaders have decided that now is the perfect time to start doing something about this. To save the species from extinction, they've appointed a world-class team of…</p>
			<p>…you.</p>
			<p>Just you. Ignore that whole "team" thing, the budget fell through again.</p>
			<p>Your job is to send starships full of settlers (up to 1000 each!) <s>and</s> <em>sorry, <strong>or</strong></em> plant seeds, to other planets to prevent extinction.</p>
			<p>Which planets? That's up to you. The fact that there are no ideal candidates is <em>your</em> problem now. You could start by sending plant seeds to Mars to try to convert the atmosphere to something breathable, but that would take decades and the plants wouldn't thrive there without liquid water. Maybe there's some other planet out there with its own plantlife already? (Who knows what elements those plants might consume and produce? You won't know until you get there.) You could even send seeds from <em>those</em> plants somewhere if you wanted to. (You'll need a thriving population of 10,000 or more on a planet in order to build and launch spaceships from it.)</p>
			<p>With you leading the way, we can become an <em>interplanetary species</em> which will surely solve all our problems for good, and not just delay the inevitable!</p>
			<p>(If you're new to this, you should pause the game as soon as it starts, so you'll have time to click on different planets and decide where to send your first mission.)</p>

			<h1>Ross-like vegetation study</h1>
			<p>Upon landing on Ross 128 b, scientists quickly set up a lab to study the local plant life. The good news: these plants are edible. The better news: they break down the toxins in industrial waste!</p>
			<p>The not-so-good news: they convert these toxins into CO<sub>2</sub>. This should be fine for now but as civilization grows and produces more toxins, the CO<sub>2</sub> will only get worse.</p>
			<p>Also: these plants need some compound as a catalyst for growth, but the scientists aren't sure what, except that it is evidently present on Ross 128 b.</p>

			<h1>Centauri-like vegetation study</h1>
			<p>Upon landing on Proxima b, scientists quickly set up a lab to study the local plant life. Turns out, these plants are capable of breaking down toxins into pure water! It seems they have the potential to thrive a lot more in the presence of some other element, but the scientists aren't sure exactly what.</p>
			<p>Oh, and just in case these plants ever get out of hand, we've prepared a way to build entire cities on floats. So don't worry about the consequences if that happens.</p>
