			<h1>It's 2082.</h1>
			<p>Your species has finally pushed your home planet past its breaking point: the atmosphere isn't only a greenhouse but just plain unsafe to breathe, and toxic crops are killing millions. Naturally, world leaders have decided that now is the perfect time to start doing something about this. To save the species from extinction, they've appointed a world-class team of…</p>
			<p>…you.</p>
			<p>Just you. Ignore that whole "team" thing, the budget fell through again.</p>
			<p>Your job is to send starships full of settlers (up to 1000 each!) <s>and</s> <em>sorry, <strong>or</strong></em> plant seeds, to other planets to prevent extinction.</p>
			<p>Which planets? That's up to you. The fact that there are no ideal candidates is <em>your</em> problem now. You could start by sending plant seeds to Mars to try to convert the atmosphere to something breathable, but that would take decades and the plants wouldn't thrive there without liquid water. Maybe there's some other planet out there with its own plantlife already? You could even send seeds from <em>those</em> plants somewhere if you wanted to. (You'll need a thriving population of 10,000 or more on a planet in order to build and launch spaceships from it.)</p>
			<p>With you leading the way, we can become an <em>interplanetary species</em> which will surely solve all our problems for good, and not just delay the inevitable!</p>
			<p>(If you're new to this, you should pause the game as soon as it starts, so you'll have time to click on different planets and decide where to send your first mission.)</p>
